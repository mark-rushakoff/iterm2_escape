iterm2_escape provides a simple interface to controlling iTerm2 through escape codes (both proprietary and standard).

Currently, it allows you to set the color of the tabs and to set the title of tabs and windows.

(iterm2_escape is in no way affiliated with [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2) -- it was just made by a fan.)
